\title{Best-Subset Search with Cross-Validation}
\usage{
best_subset_search(
  formula,
  data,
  family = stats::gaussian(),
  max_predictors = 6,
  k = 5,
  repeats = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  metric = NULL,
  max_combinations = 1e+05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model formula with the response on the left-hand side.}

\item{data}{Data frame containing the variables referenced in `formula`.}

\item{family}{Generalized linear model family. Defaults to `stats::gaussian()`.}

\item{max_predictors}{Maximum number of predictors to include in any subset.}

\item{k}{Number of cross-validation folds.}

\item{repeats}{Number of times to repeat the K-fold splitting.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer for reproducibility of the resampling.}

\item{metric}{Optional metric name. Defaults to `"mse"` for Gaussian families
and `"accuracy"` for binomial families.}

\item{max_combinations}{Upper bound on the number of subsets that will be
evaluated. Helps prevent prohibitively large searches when the predictor
count is high. Defaults to 100,000 subsets.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
  \item{summary}{Data frame with one row per subset containing the predictor
  combination, subset size, mean score, and standard deviation of the score.}
  \item{details}{Data frame with the per-fold scores for each subset, useful for
  plotting distributions as in the course solutions.}
}
}
\description{
Exhaustively evaluates predictor subsets up to a requested size using repeated
K-fold cross-validation. The function mirrors the best-subset exploration from
the STA 478 assignments, returning a tidy summary of mean performance for each
model size.
