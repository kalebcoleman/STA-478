\title{Bootstrap Test Error for Logistic Regression}
\usage{
bootstrap_performance(formula, data, B = 1000, seed = NULL, threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Logistic regression formula.}

\item{data}{Data frame containing the variables referenced in `formula`.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap replicates.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed for reproducibility.}

\item{threshold}{Probability cutoff used to convert fitted probabilities to
class predictions.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
  \item{mean_error}{Mean out-of-bag misclassification rate across bootstrap
  replicates.}
  \item{sd_error}{Standard deviation of the misclassification rate.}
  \item{distribution}{Data frame of individual bootstrap errors for plotting
  or further summarisation.}
  \item{skipped}{Number of replicates that were skipped because the bootstrap
  sample contained every observation (no out-of-bag data).}
}
}
\description{
Estimates the out-of-bag misclassification error for a logistic regression
model by repeatedly resampling the rows (with replacement) and evaluating the
fitted model on the observations left out of each resample. This mirrors the
bootstrap model assessment described in the STA 478 solutions.
